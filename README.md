# ðŸ’¸ Discount Calculator in Python

This is a simple Python script that calculates the final price of an item after applying a discount.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Takes user input for the original price and discount percentage.
- Applies the discount **only if it's 20% or more**.
- Returns either the discounted price or the original price based on the condition.
- Includes input validation to handle incorrect user entries.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

- If the discount is **20% or more**, the discount is applied.
- If it's **less than 20%**, the original price is returned unchanged.

## ðŸ§ª Sample Run

```bash
Enter the original price: 1000
Enter the discount percentage: 25
Discount applied! Final price: $750.00
